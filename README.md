# rockPaperScissors
Its a simple Rock , Paper , Scissors game


Finished the Rock Paper Scissors (console only version)

In the future i will update it to a visual Rock Paper Scissors game!
I will be making it into a smooth experience with simple colors and buttons.

This will be a Rock Paper Scissors game

First i need to make the HTML Elements for the:
Buttons Rock Paper and Scissors

second i need to create a function to randomise a choice for the computer

third i need to create a function that plays one round and checks the winner

fourth when those functions work i need to make a simple ui

fifth Create a function that will display the score

sixth Create a function that will make the game end at 5 rounds

and last Style the UI for a more clean look!
